\begin{abstract}
The development of trans-medium robots capable of operating in both air and water is hindered by the conflicting physical requirements of the two fluids: hydrodynamic efficiency favors compliant, oscillating structures, while aerodynamic flight demands high stiffness to prevent aeroelastic divergence. This paper addresses this impedance mismatch through the design of the \textit{Aero-Aqua Ray}, a bio-inspired platform featuring variable-stiffness origami wings. By integrating Liquid Metal Embedded Elastomers (LMEE) within a Miura-ori tessellation, the robot achieves active modulus modulation, transitioning between compliant mobuliform swimming and rigid ballistic gliding. We establish a unified dynamic framework coupling modified Lighthill’s Elongated Body Theory with Unsteady Blade Element Theory and implement a bifurcation-controlled Central Pattern Generator (CPG) to manage the chaotic air-water interface. Numerical simulations validate the system’s stability and reveal a significantly lower Cost of Transport (COT $\approx$ 15 J/kg$\cdot$m) compared to conventional multi-rotor hybrids, demonstrating the efficacy of soft-morphing strategies for cross-domain locomotion.
